# Writeups for ecw2k24

Each writeup contains a markdown file with the core ideas and explanation, and a folder with additional resources.
In this folder you will often find a jupyter notebook that solves some or all of the challenge.

These jupyter notebooks rely on a virtual env described in the `requirements.txt`.
